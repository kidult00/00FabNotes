Eagle software and an enormous library of components, but for the purpose of this assignment, it will be better and easier to work with the libraries already provided by the academy.

Download them here.[here.](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/doc/electronics/fab.lbr)

On the top toolbar there is a menu illustrated by two books, this is the menu Use Library, click on it and select Use. You will have to choose which libraries you want to use on the project you're working on. For the purpose of this one just add the libraries you've downloaded a while ago.

The first component you are going to place on your schematics its our microcontroller ATtiny44. Choose ATTINY44-SSU from the _FAB_Hello library and click ok to place it on your schematics.
