## Week6 Assignment

> Redraw the echo hello-world board
> 
> * add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor)
> * check the design rules, and make it
> * extra credit: simulate its operation

Since I have zero experience of circuitboard design, so I followed [this assignment note](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/figueiredo.tiago/assignments/week6.html) of fab 2014 to do my work.

Eagle provides enormous library of components, but for the purpose of this assignment, it will be better and easier to work with [the library already provided by the academy]((http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/doc/electronics/fab.lbr)).

After opening Eagle, on the top toolbar there is a menu illustrated by two books, this is the menu Use Library, click on it and select Use. For the purpose of this one just add the libraries you've downloaded a while ago.



The first component you are going to place on your schematics its our microcontroller ATtiny44. Choose ATTINY44-SSU from the _FAB_Hello library and click ok to place it on your schematics.
