### Project or Product

[My final project is a Mini Soundbot](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabshenzhen/students/417/Project-Plan/). This project was made for fab academy 2016 final project. Most of code are based on open source software and I have no plan for commerciallise. 

I see it less as a product but more as an open source project, people who like music or have some idea about theremin can play, share ideas, code. 

Maybe it can help school kids to learn sensor and frequency of notes. They could learn ultra-sonic sensor working by detecting distance between objects. And by playing the sounds, they would have sense of different notes. I'd personally be very interested in thinking about play and toys like that.
