# Final project - Mini SoundBot

![](http://7xjpra.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/%5BFabFinal%5DVideoTitle1.jpg)

### Idea

In the very beginning, I planned to make a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin). It's an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist.

But I was stucked by the osillators and complicated circut.

So I simplified it to a signal-note converter -- I call it SoundBot.

If you wave or move hands in front of the Soundbot, itâ€™ll convert the distance between your hand and the sensor into music notes. You can play a song with your hand but without touching anything. It's like touchless instrument.

### Plan
The final project deadline is 6.22. I began to prepare my final project from 6.8. Like everyweek, I felt time presure. 

I devided my work into 4 parts: design, coding, housing and testing. When I began, I only have some sketches of the idea, so I need to complete the project in about 10 days.

To use my spare time wisely, I made a project schedule to help myself concentrate on key tasks:

Task| Schedule | Outcome
--- | --- | ---
Study theremin principls | 6.9-6.11 | understanding the basic principle
Coding | 6.12-6.18 | Program works ok with arduino
Design schematic in eagle | 6.12 | PCB design
Design board in eagle | 6.13 | PCB design
Buy components | 6.15 | Taobao order
Design housing parts | 6.13-6.15 | Fusion 360 design file
Mill the borad | 6.18 | Circuit board
Soldering | 6.18 | Circuit board
Test input & output part | 6.19 | All parts work properly
Making housing parts | 6.18-6.19 | Laser cut & 3D print parts
Assemble | 6.19 | Wind up everything together
Test | 6.20-6.21 | Final test and prepare for presentation

Tasks list:

- study theremin principls
- design schematic in eagle
- design board in eagle
- buy components
- mill the borad
- soldering
- coding
- test input & output part
- design housing parts
- making housing parts
- assemble
- test
 
### Process

#### 1. Project blueprint

**Input** : I use an Ultrasonic Ranging Module HC-SR04 which detects the distance.

**Output**: At first, I've tried to use speaker like this, but it sounds a little wierd.

So I decided to use macbook as output device, my program can synthesize signal into piano-like notes:

#### 2. Coding

To use my laptop as an output, I find an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding which named [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/). It helps me simplify audio processing work.

![](http://openframeworks.cc/assets/images/of-logo.svg)

[OpenFrameworks download](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) and [setup guide for xcode](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode)

And I use one of openFrameworks addon - [micknoise/Maximilian: C++ Audio and Music DSP Library](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian). It is an audio synthesis and signal processing library written in C++. Via it's help, my program converts the sensor signals into music notes:

You can [downloan my code here](https://app.box.com/s/2u0u5edkp2lq25wybits4h9py3ofc27c).

Before making the board myself, I used Arduino for test:

#### 3. Design PCB

Since the converting job is mostly done by the program, my circuit board could be relatively simple.

#### 4. Make the board

I use RSM-20 to mill the board as usual and solder the components.

![](http://7xjpra.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/WeChat_1469357441.jpeg)

make the board by ``sudo make -f hello.HC-SR04.make program-usbtiny``


```
avr-objcopy -O ihex hello.HC-SR04.out hello.HC-SR04.c.hex;\
	avr-size --mcu=attiny45 --format=avr hello.HC-SR04.out

#### 5. Housing

The sonar sensor looks quite like a robot eye, so I can make a Wall-E housing for it. I design in Fusion 360 and it's fun.

![](http://7xjpra.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/fabfinalfusion360.png)

Then export to dxf file and inport in Coraldraw, send to GCC Laser Pro. I use speed 2.7 and power 100:

Assembly

### Test

Everything seems ready. Time for testing!

![](http://7xjpra.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/WeChat_1466488388.jpeg)

[Test video for UI when playing](https://youtu.be/j0c7WXlgJfw)


![](http://7xjpra.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/%5BFabFinal%5DVideoTitle1.jpg)

I found a bit hard to find the right note when I move my hand back and forth. There's still refinement to be made in my program.

### Presentation

And here's my final project presentation:

### Experience

In my final project, I learned some good lessons:

1. project management

	Things can go really messy if I don't have a clear plan and specific timetable. Once I decomposition the project into a task list, I know what to do next instead of just panicking. More importantly, every task should has a goal. I need to work it out with the time limits and not spend too much time in one task.
	
2. knowledge about audio and some music production princles

	I learned how a program can turn signals into meaningful notes. The scale and autio frequency are interesting. I also learned some basic concepts of music production, like propagation, amplitude, frequency and timbre.

3. how to apply a third-part framework and addons to save time and energy

	There're plenty of great projects and libraries in Github. They are all opensource and with good documentation. It's a time saving way if you find the right toolkit.

### Remaining work

The stability of the program still needs improve. If the bot can change sound volume according to the distance it'll be more like a theremin. And I can build a auto playbar control by program instead of hands.
