### My accountability in the Assignment

I mainly do the design part of the project.

Since I lives in Guangzhou, a city more than 250 kilometers away from Fablab shenzhen, I can only make it to the lab every weekend. 

So when the project started, we seprated into two groups: one responded for form and mechanical design, one for circuts and programming. And I was in the design group. I communicated with everyone mainly online or through facetime. Thanks to Viky Xie, Flex Ma, Lit Liao, Yixiao Zhang, Yang yang, I can do my work at home.

I finished design work at home and went to the lab for cutting, assembling and testing.

Based on previous work in week 9, we polished our design and made our machine body components more accurate.

### Automate our machine

We found a very useful tutorial [Getting Started With Gestalt Nodes](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/doc/MachineMakingNotes.html) from the Fabacademy website. :)
 
FabNet

[Fabnet](http://mtm.cba.mit.edu/fabinabox/dev/fabnet/overview.html) is a multi-drop network, meaning that multiple modules (a.k.a. nodes) share a single set of communication wires.

Functions:

1. Connect to PC with FTDI USB
2. Connect to the Fabnet（Gestalt Node）
3. Provides power at two voltages 12V-24V/7.5V
 
Then create a bridge board that adapts the cable to Fabnet:

Download the firmware for Gestalt Node

wxGestalt

[wxGestalt](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/doc/projects/wxgestalt.html) is a simple IDE for controlling Gestalt nodes in Python
