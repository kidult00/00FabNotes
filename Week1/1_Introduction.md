Digital fabrication

- Casual meaning: a computer controls a machine and makes stuff
- Deeper meaning: digitizing the fabrication processes; digitizing the materials themselves. I give you data and data become the thing

The road map:

- 1.0: computers control machines
- 2.0: use machines to make machines (we're here)
- 3.0: put codes in materials
- 4.0: put programs in materials
