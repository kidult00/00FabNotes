Digital fabrication

- Casual meaning: a computer controls a machine and makes stuff. I give you data and you **make a thing**
- Deeper meaning: digitizing the fabrication processes; digitizing the materials themselves. I give you data and data **becomes the thing**

The road map:

- 1.0: computers control machines
- 2.0: use machines to make machines (we're here)
- 3.0: put codes in materials
- 4.0: put programs in materials

Modular machines that Make Project

So, the goal is to make machine that makes machine!

Usually, we have different tools for the whole process.

Prof. Gershenfeld are writing [a bowser-based tool](http://mods.cba.mit.edu/) to merge all of those.

Today we are at the birth of internet of real things. Digitizing fabrication with codes and construction.

The goal of a Fab lab is to make itself obsolete.

## Project management

[Class material](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/project_management/index.html)

project management principles

* demand- vs supply-side time management

	Supply-side is you decide in advance how you going to spend your time. Plan your time in advance.

* serial vs parallel development
* spiral development

	MVP. Build the minimum viable prototype at the very beginning. Then make spiral improvement 
 
* bottom-up vs top-down debugging

* hierarchy, modularity

	Start from a little thing that works and then add parts. Develop parts separately and then aggregate them.

### Git
