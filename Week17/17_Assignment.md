## Week17 Assignment

> propose a final project that integrates the range of units covered, answering:
> 
  - what will it do?
  - who's done what beforehand?
  - what materials and components will be required?
  - where will they come from?
  - how much will it cost?
  - what parts and systems will be made?
  - what processes will be used?
  - what tasks need to be completed?
  - what questions need to be answered?
  - what is the schedule?
  - how will it be evaluated?

>  projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery
      of the skills covered

>   where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project
