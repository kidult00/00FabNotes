## Week17 Assignment

> propose a final project that integrates the range of units covered, answering:
> 
  - what will it do?
  - who's done what beforehand?
  - what materials and components will be required?
  - where will they come from?
  - how much will it cost?
  - what parts and systems will be made?
  - what processes will be used?
  - what tasks need to be completed?
  - what questions need to be answered?
  - what is the schedule?
  - how will it be evaluated?

>  projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery
      of the skills covered

>   where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project

### Final project proposal

My final project is making a theremin-like instrument.

#### what will it do?

You can play a song with your hand but without touching anything. It's like touchless instrument.

#### who's done what beforehand?

Many electronics and maker have made theremin. Gaudilab even made a opensource library [Open.Theremin](http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/). I'd like to make a simple version. And also some simplier projects [like this](http://www.instructables.com/id/Ultrasonic-Theremin/).


#### what materials and components will be required?

Hardware

- ATTiny 45 chip
- Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
- AVRISPSMD
- FTDI-SMD-HEADER
- RES 10.0K OHM 1206 SMD
- CAP CER 1UF 1206
- Dupont Line

Software

- Arduino IDE
- New Ping Library for Arduino IDE
- [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) 
- [Maximillian / ofxMaxim](github.com/micknoise/Maximilian) addon for OpenFrameworks

Housing

- basswood
- 3D Printing PLA connection parts

#### where will they come from?
- Local electronic vender
- Taobao
- wood suply
- Inventory from our fablab

#### how much will it cost?

item | quantity| cost
 --- |---|---
Attiny 45 | 1 | $ 2
HC-SR04 |1 | $ 1
AVRISPSMD|1|$ 1
FTDI-SMD-HEADER|1|$ 1
RES 10.0K OHM 1206 SMD|2|$ 0.1
CAP CER 1UF 1206|1|$ 0.1
Dupont Line|5|$ 0.1
basswood | 2 |$ 10
3D Printing PLA |1|$1
glue |1|$ 1
**TOTAL**||**$ 17**
