## Assignment

> Design, make, and document a parametric press-fit construction kit.

Press-fit means reversable joints (like lego). The goal of the kit is to make something that more than one thing.

I try to design the parametric pattern by using Antimony.

### Practise with Antimony
[Antimony](http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/3/) is a powerful "node-based" parametric CAD tool. If you have tried  Quartz composer or Origami, you'll get use to antimony in just a few minutes.


After installing, I checkout this [video tutorial](http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/3/) by Matt Keeter and made my first piece:

(By the way, [fstl](http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/fstl/) is a really great viewer for .stl files. )

Little tips:

You should use a mouse(by holding the right button) to orbit the view, which means the trackpad on a macbook is not enough.

### Design
[Tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram) is an interesting puzzle game, like the Chinese version "lego". I played it in my childhood. So I'd like to make a tangram set with antimony and lasser cutter.

Creat a new file in antimony. By adding "2D" shape, we can creat all the shape we need in a tangram.

“Difference” command helps to creat cardboard slot by subtracting a shape in another.

And "Translate" and "Rotate" modifies shapes' position.

The reason of using antimony in this lesson, is to control small "units" in a parametric way.

### Make

can't make it to the lab this week....

I'll update the cutting processing in the lab once I've done the job.
