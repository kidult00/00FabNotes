# 2.10 Week3 Note


[Computer-Controlled Cutting](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/index.html)

## CAD

[123D Make](http://www.123dapp.com/make) and other tools takes 3D shapes and decompose them to 2D parts to assemble. [Antimony](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony) is the most parametric one.

## CAM

[fab modules](http://fabmodules.org/) lets you read many file formats in, and talk to many different machines out.

## Vinyl cutter
[vinylcutter(电脑刻字机)](http://www.rolanddga.com/products/cutters/) can cut signs, pop-up cards, books, screen printing, flex, multi-layer circuits, antennas.

Should pay attension to cut depth.

## Laser cutter
Lasercutter can marking, engraving, [screen printing](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/halftone.jpg), [press-fit construction](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/gik.jpg)

Gik is sth like lego but made from cardboard. You can [design it]([gik.png](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_cutting/gik.png) in [Antimony](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony).
